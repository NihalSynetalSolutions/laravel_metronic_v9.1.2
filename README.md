#🎉 Laravel + Metronic v9.1.2 Integration
This project is a custom integration of Metronic v9.1.2 (Tailwind HTML version) with Laravel 12.x, built manually due to the lack of an official Laravel starter package for this version.

Since Metronic v9.1.2 doesn't come with Laravel support out of the box, I embedded the HTML files directly into a Laravel project, set up asset paths using Laravel's helper functions, and converted static files into Blade templates for easy reuse and modularity.

🛠️ Features
✅ Laravel 12.x

✅ Blade templating with includes for header, sidebar, and footer

✅ Assets managed using Laravel's {{ asset() }} helper

✅ TailwindCSS-based UI from Metronic

✅ Clean and modular folder structure for easy scaling

I'm happy to share this as an open-source starter kit for anyone looking to kickstart a Laravel app using Metronic v9.1.2.
